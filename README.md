Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a bounded area, consuming food and growing in length. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls of the playing area or the snake's own body.

Gameplay:
Snake Control: The player controls the direction of the snake's movement using arrow keys or other designated keys.
Food Consumption: The snake must navigate the playing area to consume food items represented by specific objects. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer.
Growth and Speed: As the snake consumes more food, it grows longer, making it increasingly challenging to maneuver without colliding with itself. Additionally, the game may increase in speed as the snake grows longer, adding to the difficulty.
Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls of the playing area or with itself. When the game ends, a "Game Over" message is displayed, and the player can choose to restart the game.
Features:
Graphics: The game typically features simple graphics representing the snake, food items, and the boundaries of the playing area.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, usually based on the number of food items consumed or the length of the snake.
Difficulty Levels: Some versions of the game may offer multiple difficulty levels, adjusting factors such as the speed of the snake and the frequency of appearance of food items.
Restart Option: After the game ends, players usually have the option to restart the game and try to achieve a higher score.
Strategy:
Players must anticipate the movements of the snake and plan their path accordingly to avoid collision.
Controlling the snake's speed and direction is crucial for navigating tight spaces and avoiding obstacles.
